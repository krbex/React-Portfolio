          I am a full stack web developer completing the University of Texas
          Coding Bootcamp in January. I have acquired a high level programming
          knowlege from the structured practice offered by the program and
          countless videos to better understand the frameworks and technologies
          I work with which now include React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js,
          GraphQL, as well as a growing understanding of MVC, Object Oriented
          Programming, and Object Relational Mapping. When I am not learning
          coding, I enjoy playing chess, video games, reading, or hiking trails
          with my dog Young Neil. I am currently seeking to work with a team
          that is creating the software that will run tomorrow.
