          I am a full stack web developer completing the University of Texas
          Coding Bootcamp in January. I have acquired a high level programming
          knowledge from the structured practice offered by the program and
          countless videos to better understand the frameworks and technologies
          I work with. These now include React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js,
          GraphQL, as well as a growing understanding of MVC, Object Oriented
          Programming, and Object Relational Mapping.

        <p>
          When I am not learning coding, I enjoy playing chess, video games,
          reading, or hiking trails with my dog Young Neil.

        <p>
          I am currently seeking to work with a team that is creating the
          software that will run tomorrow.
