                  I am a full stack web developer completing the University of
                  Texas Coding Bootcamp at the end of January. I have acquired a
                  high level programming knowledge from the structured practice
                  offered by the program and countless videos to better
                  understand the frameworks and technologies I work with.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  My background has transformed me into a detail-oriented
                  problem solver with a knack for critically thinking through
                  challenges, working in a team based setting, and always aiming
                  to improve.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  When I am not coding, I enjoy playing chess, video games,
                  reading, or hiking trails with my dog Young Neil.

                <br></br>
                <p>
                  I am currently seeking to work with a team that is creating
                  the software that will run tomorrow.
